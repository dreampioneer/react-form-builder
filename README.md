# React Form Builder 2
This package is a fork of the original react-form-builder2(https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-form-builder2) available on npm. I have made updates to the language files for personal development purposes and am planning to publish a new npm package.

For further details, please refer to the original package here(https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-form-builder2).
